# ruleof3qschur
code used for the rule of three project

We include the sage code use to computationally compute whether relations hold.
Note that what we use require all relations to be homogeneous; this allows for optimized checking for ideal inclusion, but even so most checks for relations are intractable.

*  loop.py contains the code for loop symmetric functions.
*  Qhook.py contains affirmative evidence for a rule of three with Schur Q functions with hook reading
*  remark.py contains evidence for the statement made in Remark 3.5 that more relations are necessary.
*  Qascending.py contains testing code for Schur Q functions with ascending reading. This is not mentioned in the report.
